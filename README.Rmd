**couple** provides a framework for creating and evaluating multivariate distributions, by linking one-dimensional (marginal) distributions via copulas. 

## Installation

**couple** is not yet on CRAN. You can install it from github by executing the following code in your R console:

``` r
remotes::install_github("probaverse/couple")
```

If it doesn't work, check that you have the **remotes** package installed, first.
